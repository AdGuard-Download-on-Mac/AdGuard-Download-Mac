## ℹ️ About AdGuard

AdGuard for Mac is a full-featured ad blocking and privacy protection software that integrates directly with your macOS system. It filters all network traffic, ensuring that ads, pop-ups, and trackers are blocked before they can even load in your browser or applications.  

Unlike browser-based extensions, AdGuard works system-wide, meaning it can block unwanted content across Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and any other app that connects to the internet.  

Its advanced privacy tools protect you against malicious websites, phishing attempts, and invasive tracking scripts, giving you full control over your online security.  

AdGuard’s intuitive interface makes it easy for users of all levels to configure filters, whitelist websites, and customize their ad-blocking preferences. Whether you want maximum privacy or just faster browsing, AdGuard delivers a smooth experience on macOS.
